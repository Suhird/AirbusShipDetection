# AirbusShipDetection
Kaggle Challenge to detect ships in satellite imagery provided by Airbus.

The challenge wanted kagglers to write a neural network model to detect and mark ships in satellite imagery provide by Airbus. Initially the images were processed using various techniques like run length encoding, image augemtation, creating masks of ships etc. Slight variation of U-Net model was used (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf). Concept of Image segmentaion is used.
